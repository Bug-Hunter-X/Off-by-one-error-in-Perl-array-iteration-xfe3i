This repository contains a Perl code example demonstrating a common off-by-one error during array iteration.  The `bug.pl` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected code.  The error arises from incorrectly handling the index of the last element in the array.  This is a frequent mistake in many programming languages, including Perl, highlighting the importance of careful index management when working with arrays.
